100 Days of DSA from Scratch - YouTube Series

Welcome to the 100 Days of DSA from Scratch repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is designed to support the content of my YouTube series where I break down Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) into simple, easy-to-understand lessons for beginners. Each day, I upload relevant resources, code snippets, and practice problems to help you follow along and master DSA step by step.

# Series Overview

In this series, we'll cover the fundamentals of DSA, starting from the very basics like flowcharts and pseudocode, and gradually moving into complex algorithms and data structures. Whether you're a student, a beginner in coding, or preparing for job interviews, this series is your go-to guide for DSA!

What's Included:

Lecture Notes: Comprehensive notes from each video, including explanations and code.

Code Samples: Well-commented code for all concepts and algorithms.

Practice Problems: Coding problems to help reinforce your learning.

Visual Resources: Diagrams, flowcharts, and explanations to help visualize complex topics.


# Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on the series flow, with a folder for each topic:

â”œâ”€â”€ Day 1 - Introduction to DSA

â”œâ”€â”€ Day 2 - Flowcharts & Pseudocode

â”œâ”€â”€ Day 3 - Basic Java Introduction

â”œâ”€â”€ ...

Each folder contains:

Notes.md: A detailed explanation of the concepts covered.

Code: Source code for the DSA examples used in the videos.

Exercises: Practice problems to apply your knowledge.
